This library implements a 'Defer' statement in c, allowing statements to run at
function return time, generally to do cleanup.  It is similar to 'defer' in Go
and to 'scope(exit)' in D, but note that it does not care about lexical scopes.
Integrating it into your codebase is simple; see demo.c for example usage.
